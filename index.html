            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Shrimanyogi is a biographical work on the life and the achievements of the great Maratha king, 
                Chatrapathi Shivaji. Shivaji has been a legendary figure in the Indian history.Shivaji was one of the major influences on the 
                revival of nationalism and Hindu culture during a period when centuries of rule by Muslim invaders had induced a condition of 
                apathy and indifference in the people.Over the years, many legends have been added to Shivaji's life, and it is hard to filter 
                out these embellishments and just focus on the facts.
                The author has done his best to build this book just on facts. And the facts alone are interesting enough to highlight the 
                achievements of this legendary king.
                Shivaji was a man who built a dynasty starting from nothing. His motivations were always immense pride in his culture and love 
                for his motherland. However, he was not a bigot and treated all his subjects equally well, irrespective of their religion and other
                 divisions. His battles were mostly with Muslim rulers, but he never showed any animosity towards the Muslim inhabitants of his kingdom.
                The author has presented Shivaji as he really was, with no embellishments. Shivaji was a dynamic leader, a warrior, and a nobleman. 
                He was religious without being fanatic, he was a believer, but not superstitious, he was courageous but not foolish. He was a visionary
                 who dreamt of building a Hindu kingdom in a region that was surrounded by Muslim dynasties. Yet, he was extremely practical.
                Shivaji was a courageous warrior and a great tactician. At the same time, he was also a very good administrator and the kingdom
                 he was building up became stronger under his rule. He suffered many defeats too, but he never gave up his vision, and ultimately, 
                 he did succeed in making his dream a reality.

                    With deceptive case, Sawant brings into play an exceptional stylistic innovation by combining six
                    "dramatic soliloquies" to form the nine books of this novel of epic dimensions. Four books are spoken by Karna. 
                    These are interspersed with a book each from the lips of his unwed mother Kunti, Duryodhana (who considers Karna his mainstay), 
                    Shon (Shatruntapa, his foster-brother, who here-worships him), his wife Vrishali to whom he is like a god and, last of all, Krishna. 
                    Sawant depicts an uncanny similarity between Krishna and Karna and hints at a mystic link between them, 
                    investing his protagonist with a more-than-human aura to offset the un-heroic and even unmanly acts which mar this tremendously
                     complex and utterly fascinating creating of Vyasa.</p>
